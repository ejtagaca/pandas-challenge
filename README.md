# PyCity Schools Analysis

---

District Schools: Bailey, Figueroa, Ford, Hernandez, Huang, Johnson, and Rodriguez High Schools.
Charter Schools: Cabrera, Griffin, Holden, Pena, Shelton, Thomas, Wilson, and Wright High Schools.

Conclusions and Comparisons:

There is a clear difference between Charter and District schools. 

Charter schools have significantly higher passing rates than District schools. The smaller size also seem to attribute to higher passing scores overall.

There is a clear correlation between budget per student and overall passing scores. 

In both Charter Schools and District schools, the higher the budget the higher overall passing scores.
